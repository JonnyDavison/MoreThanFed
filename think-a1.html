        <h1>WHAT IS SEASONAL FOOD? AND WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO EAT SEASONALLY?</h1>
        <p>
            We are often exposed to celebrity chefs and local restaurant menu’s singing about how important it is to eat
            seasonally. But what does that really mean, for you in your home kitchen? And What are the benefits?
        </p>

        <h2>WHAT IS SEASONAL FOOD?</h2>
        <p>food is produce that is at it’s very best at this very moment. Think fresh strawberries at your
            local farmers market in the height of the Summer sunshine. Or woodpigeon in November – plump and flavourful
            after filling their bellies with wild fruits.</p>

        <h2>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO EAT SEASONALLY?</h2>

        <h2>FLAVOUR</h2>
        <p>Even though we all like to eat strawberries all year round, the best time to eat them is when they can be
            purchased directly from a local grower shortly after harvest. You’ll be rewarded with flavour unlike any
            other. Sweet, juicy and impossible to pass by.</p>

        <h2>NUTRITION</h2>
        <p>Seasonal fruits and vegetables produced on local farms are often fresher, as they do not require long
            distances for transport. Which means you are likely to enjoy them when their are at their most nutritious.
            Unlike out of season produce which is harvested early in order to be shipped and distributed to still be
            fresh once they land on your shelves! What’s more, studies have shown that fruits and vegetables contain
            more nutrients when allowed to ripen naturally on their parent plant. Crops picked at their peak of ripeness
            are always far tastier too.</p>

        <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</h2>
        <p>Seasonal produce can grow with less human assistance i.e. pesticides and genetically modification. We know
            how these toxic compounds can contaminate the water and soil and also our health. Seasonal food is more
            likely to be locally produced as well, which reduces the load on our environment due to transport, or “food
            mileage”.</p>

        <h2>SO WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO EAT SEASONALLY?</h2>
        <p>Seasonal food is fresher, tastier and more nutritious than food consumed out of season. And it’s better for
            your local economy and the enviroment. It’s really as simple as that.</p>
