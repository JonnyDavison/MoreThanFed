                <h1>DOES WHAT I EAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON CLIMATE CHANGE?</h1>
                <h2>IN SHORT, YES.</h2>
                <p>Our food system contributes 20-30% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. These gasses cause the
                    ‘Greenhouse
                    Effect’ – which is when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Otherwise
                    referred to
                    as global warming.

                    The current intensive farming system is responsible for the majority of this figure – and takes into
                    account
                    the effects from all aspects of food production. From growing and rearing, to processing, packaging
                    and
                    delivery all over the world. </p>

                <h2>DESPITE THE GLAMORISATION OF A GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEM, WHERE WE CAN HAVE WHATEVER WE WANT, WHENEVER WE
                    WANT IT –
                    A GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEM IS FAR FROM IDEAL FOR THE PLANET.</h2>
                <p>And a massive impact could be made on our emissions if we collectively made a conscience move towards
                    a
                    system that focuses on, not only, the importance of local sourcing – but also supporting our farmers
                    to make
                    big changes to common practice.

                    The true costs of our unsustainable system are not being accurately reflected in the cheap, fast
                    system of
                    today.

                    With the chemicals we use to promote ‘growth’ and the intensive rearing of animals being as major a
                    contributor as ever, to the ever increasing issue of global warming. We need to realise that working
                    with
                    nature, rather than batting her down is an essential approach to ensure the longevity of life on the
                    planet.
                </p>
                <h2>OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS FUELED BY CONSUMER DEMAND – WHICH IS WHY WE, INDIVIDUALLY, NEED TO BE CHANGING
                    WHAT WE
                    EAT TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE, LOCAL AND SEASONAL DIET. BY DISRUPTING THE CURRENT SYSTEM, AND TAKING
                    RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR FOOD CHOICES, WE CAN MOVE THE MARKET IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.</h2>
                <p>Everyone who eats, is responsible for the impact their food choices have on the earth. Which is why
                    we all
                    need to take a long, hard look at what we are purchasing. Finding ways to reduce, and ideally,
                    remove our
                    negative effects on the planet needs to be one of our top priorities. All whilst also feeding an
                    ever
                    growing population.</p>
                <p>There is no simple solution to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions – but it is possible. And we
                    need to be
                    working hard to make as much of an impact as possible.</p>
