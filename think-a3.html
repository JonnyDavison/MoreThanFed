        <h1>SHOULD US HUMANS REALLY BE EATING MEAT AT ALL?</h1>
        <h2>NO, WE DON’T THINK HUMANS SHOULD STOP EATING MEAT.</h2>
        <p>
            BUT…… the important thing here is the quantity of meat that we eat & how we farm.
            <br>
            These two factors have a massive effect on the out put of GHGs, pollution and waste generated. Pasture
            raring is not only higher welfare and lower emissions and when ground unsuitable for crops is utilised it
            becomes a much better farming system. Producing food on land that would otherwise be rendered useless,
            increases our efficiency, maximised production and helps close the loop in our current food system. Systems
            that take into consideration the whole picture are vital to account for the costs other than financial.
            Measuring the efficiency & success of our system needs to be judged in a wider context than profit & loss
            sheet. This monetary orientated outlook is unsustainable and isn’t viable in the longterm, especially with
            an expanding world population increasing pressure on the planets resources.
        </p>
        <p>Addressing the western diet is another important issue, the quantity of meat in our diet needs to reduce
            dramatically and shift in favour of pasture rared, high quality & high welfare meat. Making up the loss in
            calories from meat in favour of vegetables, beans and pulses puts less pressure on the environment and
            benefits our heath immensely. Where as less developed countries need to increase their consumption of meat
            to aid with healthy balanced diets. Balance is the main word that strikes me when I think about this, it all
            needs to balance, and at the moment it doesn’t stack up. Removing meat from our diets, that also doesn’t
            stack up, not all areas are good for producing vegetables and grains in enough quantity to sustain us. There
            isn’t anything wrong with producing meat if its done n the right fashion, with a holistic approach rather
            than a simple profit & loss sheet, in that set up there is no accountability for poor animal welfare, loss
            of habitat, loss of bio diversity and arguably most importantly loss of respect for food.
