                <h1>HOW CAN WE FEED THE WORLD? AND IT’S EVER GROWING POPULATION?</h1>
                <p>It’s 2018 and as the world’s population continues to grow at an ever increasing speed. We need to
                    re-evaluate
                    our food system. With barely 30 years before the global population hits a predicted 9.7billion, in
                    2050. How
                    are we going to continue to feed our population. How can we feed the world?</p>
                <p>There is no doubt in my mind, that we will not be able to feed everyone with our current food system.
                    To say
                    ‘It’s broken!’ is an understatement! The problem is ever-increasing and there’s certainly no easy
                    solution.
                    Which is why we need to act soon, before it’s too late.</p>
                <h2>FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ONE HUGE ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM IS THE STRUCTURE OF INDUSTRIAL SCALE FARMING.
                </h2>
                <p>In the main, it ignores the long-term effects of its methods. In favour of producing large yields as
                    quickly
                    and as cheaply as possible. But do we really know the cost of this cheap food? Have we weighed up
                    the costs
                    on our health care, nutrition, soils, waterways and of course – the flavor of the final product?
                </p>
                <p>The work is never ending and poorly remunerated. Farmers have been forced to seek ways of expanding
                    the
                    bottom line. Example. Resulting in the more sustainable, traditional ways of farming in years gone
                    by, being
                    pushed to the side; to enable the system to keep going.

                    <br> As is the case with much of ‘big business’ – our food system is mainly controlled by those who
                    stand to
                    gain the most financially. This is a flaw in the system. How can we allow big industry to buy
                    ingredients at
                    less than they truly cost to produce? Farm subsidies were introduced to enable our local farmers to
                    continue
                    to produce, while making a loss. But this leaves our farmers with little or no option, as to whether
                    to
                    comply and continue to feed the system. The processors then mix and stretch these ingredients to
                    produce
                    meals that are lacking in nutrition. Or if truth be told, even much flavour. Yet a highly profitable
                    and
                    shelf stable product that can be transported and sold as “cheap food’.
                    <br>
                    On the shop shelf the true costs aren’t always clear to the consumer. Who aren’t always aware of
                    real
                    ingredients in their meals. Much of this processed food is high in fat. Ladden with sugar and salt.
                    low in
                    nutritional value. And has been grown in soils that are void of life, with crops that are fed by
                    chemicals.
                    Vegetables grown like this are often sprayed relentlessly leading to run off that pollutes our
                    waterways.
                    And of course, produces crops that are lacking in the vibrant flavour and life that produce that
                    grown with
                    love and care have. </p>
                <h2>HOW DO WE AVOID THE COSTS OF THIS ‘CHEAP FOOD’? </h2>
                <p>
                    We grew food for 1000’s of years before the advent of industrial farming. Our current methods of
                    farming
                    have had such a negative effect on the planet, that we need to become accountable for our actions.
                    We need
                    to nourish nature. By returning to methods that increase soil health and nutrition, we will create a
                    long-term increase in yields, produce nutritious, more resistant crops and provide healthier food
                    for all

                    <br>Ironically the companies that are forcing farmers to become ruthlessly efficient, just to
                    survive
                    another year, are the opposite. They create waste, waste beyond imagination. They reject crops that
                    are not
                    aesthetically pleasing. Creation of unnecessary packaging such as single use plastics and other non
                    recyclables. And often ‘cut corners’ in a race to the bottom. This race to provide the cheapest food
                    at any
                    cost is not doing us any favours. We’re fighting against nature, destroying the very thing that
                    gives us
                    life.

                    <br>Of course, feeding the planet is a much more complicated problem than conducting a simple
                    calculation of
                    how many tons of ‘X’ can be produced, and how can we bulk it out with ‘Y’ and ship it to ‘Z’. A much
                    broader
                    debate needs to happen here. Our system as a whole wastes 30% of its production. We can already feed
                    the
                    planet. We can already produce food for everyone. Yet people are starving, while the rest are
                    happily
                    throwing it away.
                </p>
                <h2>SO WHAT DO WE DO?</h2>
                <p>The realisation that the current system is broken, needs to be listened to. And responsibility lies
                    with
                    everyone. We all eat!
                    <br>To change the system we need to revise our farming methods, work with nature, increase our
                    perception of
                    the value of food, and stop treating it as a cheap commodity that can be so easily wasted.
                    <br>Our reward for this is healthy, nutritious food, that feeds the planet – allowing us to live
                    alongside
                    nature. </p>
