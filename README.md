# MoreThanFed_

[More Than Fed](github deployed) was created to connect with people who care about what they eat, sustainability and the ethics surrounding food.
 
We provide informative content for inquisitive minds. More Than Fed makes eating local, fresh produce seem less of a challenge with accessible ways to make sustainable, ethical changes. We believe that when you know where your food has come from, who produced it and the effort that went into getting it from field to fork, then you are more likely to appreciate itâ€™s true value. 

We want to offer up interesting debates about the food industry. How our food is produced, and why it matters.
