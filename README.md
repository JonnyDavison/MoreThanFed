## [More Than Fed](https://jonnydavison.github.io/MoreThanFed/index.html) was created to connect with people who care about what they eat, sustainability and the ethics surrounding food.
We provide informative content for inquisitive minds. More Than Fed makes eating fresh local produce seem less of a challenge with accessible ways to make sustainable, ethical changes. We believe that you are more likely to appreciate its actual value when you know where your food has come from, who produced it and the effort that went into getting it from field to fork.

We want to offer up exciting debates about the food industry. How our food is produced, and why it matters.

## Testing 
Testing throughout the development process ensured the functionality and flow gave both good UX and UI. Further testing led to format changes for the images to reduce their size, further increasing the loading speeds and better UX. 

As development moved to responsiveness, there were increases to the breakpoint px, and a further breakpoint was added to improve results.  

- Browser tests on Chrome, Firefox and Safari
    - Note that older versions of safari do not support .webp image format
- Responsiveness tests, Chrome dev tools
    - Tests resulted in additional breakpoints
-  Accessibility 
    - All components meet accessibility expectations, contrast and readability 
- Internal Links 
    - Flow and assist the navigation of the site
- External Links    
    - To further resources, including social media, open in a separate tab to assist UX navigation
- Newsletter & Sign Up forms
    - Function as expected; both contain required fields, including email address
    - Note that the forms share to a CI form dump as the site is built for educational purposes only
